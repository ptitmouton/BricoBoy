# BricoBoy GB Emulator

This is a GameBoy emulator written in Rust.
It is very much a work in progress and is not yet in a usable state.
It also very well may never be in a usable state.

It brings nothing new whatsoever to the table, it is just a learning project for me,
something to have a little fun with.
